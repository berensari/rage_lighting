Rage Lighting Doc

RAGE lighting (Starting tricks) :

For example, if you are building a house:
Search for the shell of Michael's villa in rpf explorer
Open the file location (dlc)
Export all models
Export YTYP as XML
Import all models and ytyp into blender
Do research on the lights in the interior (Which type of light is placed where, at what temperature, etc.)

Make your light placement in your own space by taking those lights as reference.

You can adapt this tactic to different interiors. If you are going to make a dark theme place, you can apply the same processes to a dark theme place by Rockstar.


**CONTRAST**

Don't be afraid of contrast differences, this will help you achieve realism
